                <li>1/4 cup sesame oil</li>
                <li>1/4 cup lemon juice</li>
                <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar, or more to taste</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon sesame seeds</li>
                <li>1 teaspon ground mustard</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
                <li>4 (6 ounce) salmon steaks</li>
            </ul>

        <p><strong>Directions</strong></p>
            <ol>
                
                    <li>Mix sesame oil, lemon juice, soy sauce, brown sugar, sesame seeds, ground mustard, ginger, and garlic powder in a small saucepan over low heat. Bring to a simmer, stirring until sugar has dissolved. Set aside 1/2 cup of marinade for basting.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Pour remaining marinade into a resealable plastic bag and place salmon into the marinade. Squeeze air out of the bag, seal, and marinate the salmon steaks for at least 1 hour (2 hours for better flavor). Drain and discard used marinade.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Set oven rack about 4 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Place salmon steaks into a broiler pan and broil for 5 minutes. Brush steaks with reserved marinade, turn, and broil until fish is opaque and flakes easily, about 5 more minutes. Brush again with marinade.</li>
